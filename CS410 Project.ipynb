      "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "1.Background: I got my MS in CS from UIUC and taught a couple of undergraduate courses there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The course levels at UIUC range from 100(Undergraduate) to 500 (Graduate). I found most 400 and 500 level courses to be rigorous, thorough with a right mix of theory and practice. The assignments, machine problems, take homes and exams were well thought and tested the right abilities of a candidate to get an A. Some advance courses such as Advance algorithms and Machine learning are very hard, while some are easy. Almost every professor I worked with had a very relevant background, solid research experience and knowledge. Students ranked from ok'ish to some of the smartest people I have met. I have personally learned a lot from my peers and other students in my classes as well as my TA classes. The Computer Science building (Siebel center) is a state of the art building with fully equipped labs and a nice cafe. The staff is also very helpful. TAs and professors are busy but approachable. Scholarships are plenty and department funding is very good. Alumni network is well established and very strong. The reputation of UIUC CS in both academia and industry is very good. You grow both as an engineer and human being in such a competitive environment with high expectations and tight deadlines and you learn a lot. Last but not the least, the opportunities in terms of research projects, hackathons, startup opportunities, internships and full time jobs are ample and you find your journey to be both challenging and rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I found UIUC�s CS students to be at par with most Stanford Engineering students that I have worked with for assignments, projects and general brain storming sessions. But personally speaking, I think UIUC has a slight edge when it comes to forming the habbit of self study because of its location (less distractions) and weather (ice ice everywhere) that keeps students at home or inside Siebel center. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2.Thanks for the A2A.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a current CS student here at UIUC, I can say that it's really an amazing place, inside and out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other people mentioned that the courseload can be a lot to handle. It definitely can be if you decide to take 18 (the maximum amount) credit hours a semester, all of them being from technical classes. However, if you pace yourself well, be reasonable about your schedule, and take a good balance of both gen-eds and core classes, you shouldn't be working your head off every single week. Some also mentioned that it can be hard to stand out from the 400 other CS students in your class. It can be�but as long as you pursue what you're interested in and actively apply for jobs/internships, you should be fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is especially interesting/fun after you finish the basic classes and can start diving into the many different specific fields within CS that interest you most. Not to mention you can start getting better internships from your advanced knowledge of the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best parts of UIUC, however, is that it's more than just a small technical school like some of its competitors. You get the actual college experience (big 10 sports, great parties, a top rec center in the nation, clubs for almost anything you can think of, etc). If you balance yourself correctly, you can get so much more than just a world-class CS degree from this amazing University.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3.Even graduating just a year ago, I am not sure I will provide the most accurate picture for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "CS starts with getting in, which required very high standards (mine were way lower than today even). You struggle to find space in your core classes as many are full and you need them to fit your schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beginning classes have a decent amount of work to them. Many students go into these classes already experienced while the new to Cs students work much harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the class difficulty increases. It gets much harder to save your homework til the last days. You still struggle to register for the classes you need, especially the tech elective you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, it is coming down to the graduate on time portion. You have to hope your classes fit your schedule. You may be taking all CS classes without a gened reliever because you can finally have registration priority. You may still not get the electives you most wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, graduation comes and you hopefully have a CS job lined up. You are mostly relieved that your large workloads are over and you tend to be able to show your companies some very good technical ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "You then get into the work place and being the developer with a uiuc degree is both a blessing and a curse. You are the guy that gets things done. There are quite a few blocks that frustrate you especially since uiuc taught you in a way to be self-reliant. You may even find that you work with programmers rather than computer scientists (and being a uiuc student, you hopefully learned the difference).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4.CS has been very difficult to get in. A lot of people I know were admitted to Computer Engineering (CompE) while their first choice was CS. You can try to transfer into CS after you come, but this path has been more and more difficult. I will say if you are really passionate about CS and are willing to get good grades, then transferring into CS might be easier than admitted into CS as a Freshman. Another way is to choose CompE which many friends of mine did and focus on taking CS classes (though you will have to fight for registering a CS class and go through 3 ~ 4 mandatory hardware classes). Hope that helps!\n",

      "5.The Computer Science major at UIUC is extremely selective.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend applied to UIUC as Computer Science major and he was put in pre-engineering in UIUC�s College of LAS. He had a very high GPA and SAT score, however he had no extracurricular activities. Perhaps if my friend was more involved or had a higher SAT score, then maybe he would have been accepted to the Computer Science major.\n",
      "\n",
      "If one is put into pre-engineering, one can still be a Computer Science major. However, it is very difficult. One of the opinions of an Assistant Dean at UIUC�s College of Engineering is: if one is put in pre-engineering at UIUC and wants to be a Computer Science major, go to another university if one is accepted into their Computer Science major. The way to get into the Computer Science major through pre-engineering is one must have at least a 3.75 GPA and a few more unspecified items by the end of Freshmen year.\n",
