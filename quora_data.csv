https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-study-computer-science-at-UIUC,Yes,What is it like to study computer science at UIUC?,"Background: I got my MS in CS from UIUC and taught a couple of undergraduate courses there.

The course levels at UIUC range from 100(Undergraduate) to 500 (Graduate). I found most 400 and 500 level courses to be rigorous, thorough with a right mix of theory and practice. The assignments, machine problems, take homes and exams were well thought and tested the right abilities of a candidate to get an A. Some advance courses such as Advance algorithms and Machine learning are very hard, while some are easy. Almost every professor I worked with had a very relevant background, solid research experience and knowledge. Students ranked from ok'ish to some of the smartest people I have met. I have personally learned a lot from my peers and other students in my classes as well as my TA classes. The Computer Science building (Siebel center) is a state of the art building with fully equipped labs and a nice cafe. The staff is also very helpful. TAs and professors are busy but approachable. Scholarships are plenty and department funding is very good. Alumni network is well established and very strong. The reputation of UIUC CS in both academia and industry is very good. You grow both as an engineer and human being in such a competitive environment with high expectations and tight deadlines and you learn a lot. Last but not the least, the opportunities in terms of research projects, hackathons, startup opportunities, internships and full time jobs are ample and you find your journey to be both challenging and rewarding.

Also, I found UIUCÕs CS students to be at par with most Stanford Engineering students that I have worked with for assignments, projects and general brain storming sessions. But personally speaking, I think UIUC has a slight edge when it comes to forming the habbit of self study because of its location (less distractions) and weather (ice ice everywhere) that keeps students at home or inside Siebel center. :)"

As a current CS student here at UIUC, I can say that it's really an amazing place, inside and out.

Other people mentioned that the courseload can be a lot to handle. It definitely can be if you decide to take 18 (the maximum amount) credit hours a semester, all of them being from technical classes. However, if you pace yourself well, be reasonable about your schedule, and take a good balance of both gen-eds and core classes, you shouldn't be working your head off every single week. Some also mentioned that it can be hard to stand out from the 400 other CS students in your class. It can beÑbut as long as you pursue what you're interested in and actively apply for jobs/internships, you should be fine.

It is especially interesting/fun after you finish the basic classes and can start diving into the many different specific fields within CS that interest you most. Not to mention you can start getting better internships from your advanced knowledge of the field.

One of the best parts of UIUC, however, is that it's more than just a small technical school like some of its competitors. You get the actual college experience (big 10 sports, great parties, a top rec center in the nation, clubs for almost anything you can think of, etc). If you balance yourself correctly, you can get so much more than just a world-class CS degree from this amazing University."
https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-study-computer-science-at-UIUC,Yes,What is it like to study computer science at UIUC?,"Even graduating just a year ago, I am not sure I will provide the most accurate picture for you.

CS starts with getting in, which required very high standards (mine were way lower than today even). You struggle to find space in your core classes as many are full and you need them to fit your schedule.

The beginning classes have a decent amount of work to them. Many students go into these classes already experienced while the new to Cs students work much harder.

Then, the class difficulty increases. It gets much harder to save your homework til the last days. You still struggle to register for the classes you need, especially the tech elective you want.

Then, it is coming down to the graduate on time portion. You have to hope your classes fit your schedule. You may be taking all CS classes without a gened reliever because you can finally have registration priority. You may still not get the electives you most wanted.

Then, graduation comes and you hopefully have a CS job lined up. You are mostly relieved that your large workloads are over and you tend to be able to show your companies some very good technical ability.

You then get into the work place and being the developer with a uiuc degree is both a blessing and a curse. You are the guy that gets things done. There are quite a few blocks that frustrate you especially since uiuc taught you in a way to be self-reliant. You may even find that you work with programmers rather than computer scientists (and being a uiuc student, you hopefully learned the difference)."
https://www.quora.com/How-hard-is-it-to-get-into-computer-science-at-UIUC,Yes,How hard is it to get into computer science at UIUC?,"CS has been very difficult to get in. A lot of people I know were admitted to Computer Engineering (CompE) while their first choice was CS. You can try to transfer into CS after you come, but this path has been more and more difficult. I will say if you are really passionate about CS and are willing to get good grades, then transferring into CS might be easier than admitted into CS as a Freshman. Another way is to choose CompE which many friends of mine did and focus on taking CS classes (though you will have to fight for registering a CS class and go through 3 ~ 4 mandatory hardware classes). Hope that helps!"
https://www.quora.com/How-hard-is-it-to-get-into-computer-science-at-UIUC,Yes,How hard is it to get into computer science at UIUC?,"The Computer Science major at UIUC is extremely selective.

My friend applied to UIUC as Computer Science major and he was put in pre-engineering in UIUCÕs College of LAS. He had a very high GPA and SAT score, however he had no extracurricular activities. Perhaps if my friend was more involved or had a higher SAT score, then maybe he would have been accepted to the Computer Science major.

If one is put into pre-engineering, one can still be a Computer Science major. However, it is very difficult. One of the opinions of an Assistant Dean at UIUCÕs College of Engineering is: if one is put in pre-engineering at UIUC and wants to be a Computer Science major, go to another university if one is accepted into their Computer Science major. The way to get into the Computer Science major through pre-engineering is one must have at least a 3.75 GPA and a few more unspecified items by the end of Freshmen year."

However, there are more students admitted into CS than matriculated. So assuming a yield rate of 50% (one out of every two students admitted into CS@UIUC matriculate), the acceptance rate would be 10%."
https://www.quora.com/How-is-life-as-a-computer-science-student-at-UIUCs-college-of-engineering,Yes,How is life as a computer science student at UIUC's college of engineering?,"I asked this same question about a year ago when I was making my decision between UIUC and the other school's I had been accepted into.

I've spent less than a year here, but I think I have gotten a good grasp on the atmosphere of the CS department.

Academics: The focus on academics at UIUC, especially in the CS / Engineering departments is very high. You'll be taking a fair amount of background STEM courses (usually the full Calculus track + Linear Algebra and other higher level math courses, 2.5 semesters of Physics, 1 semester of Chemistry) as well as some General Education / Liberal Arts courses. The CS course track is fairly diverse; once you clear the 6 or so (there may be more, I can't remember right now) mandated courses you are opened up to chose between several technical tracks, allowing you to customize your program of study to your unique interests.

Extracurriculars: There are absolutely tons of Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) on campus in basically any area you'd be interested in. Specifically in CS/Eng we have ACM - a general computing group with a dozen or so special-interest-groups, WCS (Women in Computer Science), IEEE - more focused on the EE and ECE side of things, and others. You'll find tons of motivated, like-minded people working on interesting projects in all of these groups. They're all really welcoming, and will help you find your areas of interest.

Job Opportunities: Students at UIUC really are in high demand for jobs in the CS field. We have several career fairs every semester which are packed with big companies and startups alike. We've had dozens of people intern at recognizable companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc. These types of internships are the rule, not the exception. Additionally, we have a really active 'research park' on campus that offers 'on campus' internships and research opportunities for students of all years.

Social Life: Just throwing this out there, UIUC was ranked the #1 party school as of last year. If this appeals to you, then there you go. If it doesn't, Greek Life and 'party culture' really won't affect you. It's easy to avoid the craziness if you want. That being said, the variety of other RSOs will ensure that you can find interesting social events no matter what your interests are.

Unique Attributes: Having not gone to any other CS programs, I can only talk concretely about UIUC. However, after talking to friends that have gone to talk to other schools, I've been able to draw the following comparisons: CS@UIUC is more of a collaborative, non-competitive department than other institutions. Once you're in the department, you're in for good. Even though this is a state school, there aren't 'filter' classes designed to flunk people out of the program. We have tons of structures in place to ensure the success of all students in engineering.

Hopefully you have a better understanding of what it's like to be a student in CS at UIUC!"

While it may be true that UIUC has a high OVERALL acceptance rate (40% - 50%) when compared to other top CS schools like MIT, Stanford & Caltech, the CS department has a much lower acceptance rate.

Last year, UIUC emailed all admitted CS students saying that out of the 4000 applications they received for all the seven programs of CS, only 300 spots were available (across all seven programs). So the best students were taken.

Only 7.5% of all applicants were admitted into the program! Not as easy as you think."

Are you going by admit rate? Average GPA and ACT/SAT scores?

I guess what I'm saying is that your premise is wrong. CS at Illinois is extremely selective, if a bit less selective than CMU and UCB, the only higher ranked schools that admit directly to their CS programs. There are few if any lower ranked schools with demonstrably lower admit rates or higher average GPA/ACT/SATs that admit directly to major, so who would you rank higher than Illinois (based simply on how hard it is to get in)?

Would you rank Yale over Illinois in CS based on the school's overall admit rate? You might choose Yale over Illinois for many reasons, but that doesn't mean its CS program is better or should be ranked higher."

I could answer from what I know from my friends in the CS department and auditing a course there.

https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-University-of-Illinois-at-Chicago,No,What is your review of University of Illinois at Chicago?,"It was a terrific experience for me. As an undergraduate, I commuted there and worked full-time. Like Jessica Yeager, I also graduated from there with an M.A.T. in history, so I fully concur with every that she said. In addition, I have just finished another degree (M.Ed in curriculum and instructional studies) because of UICÕs reputation, particularly in regards to urban education. There are a lot of great perks to attend, especially if you are a graduate student. If you are an undergraduate, and want a true college experience, then UIC may not be the place for you. But if you were like meÑa working undergraduate student paying for collegeÑthen UIC is full of people just like you. Almost everybody works a job while studying at UIC as a student, so UIC is unlike other universities in this respect.

HereÕs what I wrote for another question about being a graduate student at UIC and the perks the university has to offer as a graduate student. It may just help you:

I attended the University of Illinois at Chicago from 1987Ð1995 for both a double B.A. in history and political science as well as graduate degrees in history and education. I have just completed my M.Ed. in curriculum and instructional studies this year, so I would like to think I am qualified to answer this question about the perks of attending my alma mater. Where do I begin?

First, it all depends on what type of graduate degree you are pursuing. One applies to a graduate college based on the strength of their program and the faculty members behind it whose courses you will be taking. I am a high school history teacher at an urban high school, and I selected the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) because their College of Education is cutting edge when it comes to research and studies on urban education and they concentrate on African-American and Latino students specificallyÑwho happen to be the cultural and ethnic make-up of my student body. Since I had previously attended UIC for my undergraduate and graduate pursuits more than twenty years ago, you could say I went with the devil I know bestÑthat and the fact the program specializes in the type of school that I have taught in for the last twenty-one years. I did not want to take the risk of attending a school I have never attended before and find out it was not the right fit.

Chicago boasts many fine universities, such as Northwestern, Loyola, Depaul, and the University of Chicago, but they are all private institutions and their tuition rates are quite high and out of my price range. So one perk is definitely a better financial deal. There are cheaper education programs for teachers near where I live (which is next door in Oak Park), but I went with UIC because they specialize in urban education using the Chicago Public School as its laboratory. I have classes with top-notch professors who lead the research in education reform and who are a powerful influence on the State of IllinoisÕs Board of Education (it was UIC who led the way in getting the state to improve the school principal and superintendent certification and training requirements). As I have said before, there are cheaper education programs for teachers, but UIC is still affordable, more so than the private universities. Northwestern and University of Chicago maybe ivy-league and boast truly beautiful campuses (UICÕs architecture can be characterized as brutalism in its architecture), but cost-wise, itÕs the better financial deal.

Another perk is the diverse student body. UIC is rated in the top five U.S. universities in student diversity. I am taking classes with a great mix of both local and international students, and the viewpoints and contributions of the student body is incredible and insightful. In my latest class, there is a generous mix of Latino, African-American, white, foreign-born Asian, and Muslim studentsÑa definite melting pot. Getting their perspectives on issues raised in the class is an education onto itself and a valuable cultural resource and tool for any student.

Another good perk about UICÕs graduate programs is that they are rigorous. UIC does not play around. ItÕs serious business when you are enrolled in a graduate program. My M.A. in history required blood, sweat, and tears to complete. I had language requirements to fulfill, masterÕs thesis to complete in a semester (Cloaked as a Òseminar paperÓÑdonÕt let the name fool you. It was a damned thesis and treated as such.), and an exit graduate examination on my major and minor areas of focus that took a week to complete. Imagine every day sitting and writing for six hours on three questions. Failing one question meant failing the entire examination process. Every program has different requirements, some not as rigorous as others. My current graduate program does not have a language or thesis requirement, but there is a great deal of work and the professors make you tie it into what you are doing in order to make it as practical as possible. Many of my classes do not have exams but projects to complete that require thorough mastery of the material studied in class and its application to the real world. It takes as much time if not more to complete than preparing for mid-term or final exams and just as nerve-wracking. Write to your professors and ask them for their course syllabi to get an idea of what they require and how they will assess you for their classes.

For graduate students in education, UIC offers most of its course at night between the hours of 4 pm and 8 pm. This is perfect for the working teacher or administrator. UIC also offers two types of summer-term schedules: a four-week and an eight-week section for some courses. But most graduate courses are usually offered during the morning and afternoon.

UIC is also a Tier I research institution. That means the university is truly focused on cutting-edge research, and they have a fine faculty to carry out that research. YouÕll be rubbing shoulders with professors who have made their mark on the latest research, but, again, it all depends on which area you are pursuing in your graduate degree. UIC is great in some respects, like engineering, computer science, mathematics, architecture, medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, history, philosophy, and education, but it is weak in other areas. Do your homework to find out where UIC stands in a particular field.

What about the location? You are stoneÕs throw away from downtown. You can easily access the city and UIC is easy to get to by way of the CTA. You have the entire city as your backyard. Already Chicago is equal to New York in cuisine, the city boasts many fine museums and other cultural institutions to spend a day within, and Chicago has an incredible array of different neighborhoods to explore. Take advantage of that!

Now for the drawbacks:

ItÕs not strong in every single graduate program. Do your homework and research where it stands. Try looking at U.S. News and World Report to see where UIC ranks in certain areas.
Ugly architecture. The university has made great strides in beautifying the campus, but many of the buildings are still Orwellian in their design.
Not all of the professors are great instructors. They maybe leading experts in their research fields, but that does not translate into being excellent teachers. Do your homework and ask around to find the good professors. Visit or email them and ask questions.
It doesnÕt boast a first-class library like University of ChicagoÕs Regenstein Library or the Newberry Library downtown. ItÕs sufficient, but thatÕs it.
Not every course in the graduate catalog is offered in reality. Check this out since what the catalog boasts can be misleading. Do your homework and ask people is certain courses you are interested in taking are even being offered. When they are offered is important, too. Some are offered only during spring or summer terms, or at certain times of day. I initially wanted to pursue a graduate degree in museum studies, but the program only offers courses in the morning and afternoonÑnot good for someone who works 7 am - 4 pm.
The politics of UIC leave a lot to be desired. UIC is notorious for its petty academic and administrative politics, but thankfully, its usually confined to the people who work there and not the students who attend, but you still get some spillover. ItÕs a great place to be a student, but not for the employee who works there and has to deal with the Byzantine politics of their colleagues and administration. But thatÕs academia for you!
There are many hidden financial costs. Some programs require that you spend extra money. TheyÕll charge you for health insurance automatically unless you provide proof of insurance directly. In addition, if you are a full-time student, they will charge you $140 for a train pass to encourage you to take the train. Great for some people, but not great for those who commute a long way by car or who do not wish to take the train home late at night. There is no getting out of this charge.
So to summarize the perks of attending UIC as a graduate student:

A great research university with a terrific academic reputation.
ItÕs location is easily accessible and you have the great city of Chicago at your fingertips. Bike there, drive there, or just take the train.
ItÕs affordableÑmore so than other institutions. It is not the cheapest, but it will not break you financially. I went there full-time for eight years straight while working full-time and only came out with $5000 in debtÑand that was incurred during my last year there. Manage your money and you should do fine.
It boasts a diverse student body. ItÕs like the United Nations on the campus and most students have said they feel welcome on the campus.
ItÕs rigorous and challenging. People respect UIC graduates because of it. Employers hire us because of it. I proudly hang my framed degrees on my walls and tell people I am a graduate of that institution.
A flexible summer school in most cases.
It possesses many great graduate programs. Out of all of the local universities, I have never seen as many programs than those being offered at UIC.
If you make your choice to attend the University of Illinois at Chicago for graduate school, then welcome aboard!

And if you choose to attend UIC as an undergraduate, youÕll still have a great experience like the one I had. I like to think that UIC helped make me the person I am today. It offered many wonderful academic experiences and connected me to my first real job as a teacher, and I am still teaching at the same school for the last twenty-two years!"
https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-University-of-Illinois-at-Chicago,No,What is your review of University of Illinois at Chicago?,"9/10

I'm almost done getting my Teaching of History degree from UIC and I have really enjoyed my experience. I feel prepared to enter the field and I feel confident in my abilities that were well fostered by the program. I'll list off things I think are important while looking for a university and say what I think about UIC in regards to them.

Professors and Staff: There is a good mix, mostly I have great experiences, especially at higher levels when professor quality is most important because it may be the difference between being prepared for your career and being unprepared. Advisors are also great and very helpful.

Campus: UIC doesn't have the prettiest buildings but it is a very nice campus. There are many lovely spots to sit under a tree and soak in the sun between classes. It is also well-kept. Trees are cared for, grass is green and the campus is clean. During the winter, snow is usually quickly taken care of (except for freak storms). There are also shuttle buses for students to get across the campuses.

Location: Campus is also in a great location. Close to downtown, if you are commuting from the suburbs you have the blue line or the Metra which are close and UIC gets deep discounts for the CTA and Pace (I think).

Programs: I have met many professionals that has gone through UIC and gotten good jobs. There is a decent chance if you make it through a program that is in demand, you'll be able to find a job that relates. The programs and school are well respected.

Cost: Considering, UIC is rather affordable. College is expensive but UIC is a good choice if you want anything higher than a 2 year degree. You can get a lot of bang for your buck.

Clubs and sports: There are a lot, UIC students have a lot of options. I was never apart of one because of work and other responsibilities but judging by the fair they have, clubs are alive and well.

Dorms and student life: I was never in the dorms but those I know liked the experience and there is a lot students can do in and around campus. There is a gym, bowling alley, arcade, pool tables. A Dunkin Donuts, Wendy's, Subway, Sbarros and a Mexican restaurant in the student center and many others within walking distance.

All in all, I would recommend UIC"
https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-University-of-Illinois-at-Chicago,No,What is your review of University of Illinois at Chicago?,"It is a great place located very close to Chicago downtown. I am a graduate student in Department of Computer Science. It can teach you a lot. You might start thinking that my review is biased, if you compare it to some other older universities around, but it is a good place to learn a lot."
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,"Nope. Loved it. City setting. Interesting neighborhood (back in the late 60s). Excellent instructors. I felt lucky not to have to return to Champaign or transfer to some other college in order to finish. No regrets at all. I remember what a kick it was to be there opening day in January Ô65. I remember PuertoÕs, the little Mexican restaurant on Roosevelt Road where I did most of my studying and where a neighborhood woman sat down one day with a broken bottle declaring that she was going to cut me. Colorful. I bought her some soup and some coffee, so no blood was shed."
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,"I have some regrets in my life, U.I.C. was definitely not one of them. UIC gave me a second chance I did not deserve but I made the most of it. It was Circle Campus then and they hadnÕt yet destroyed the Maxwell Street Market where I learned to play the blues and bought my own hubcaps back. I graduated from high school at 17, privileged, stupid, and thanks to strict Asian parents not able to make any decisions, well any good decisions on my own. So National Merit Scholar failed out of Duke University with a GPA that was lower than todayÕs average savings account interest. Financially disowned I had to write a letter to a dean, then meet with him to get accepted into UIC and admittedly it was a good letter. I worked my way through two or three classes and two or three jobs a quarter, graduating with zero student debt and in spite of my wasted semesters at Duke, a B+ average. Going to college part time like that I didnÕt do well enough on the MCATs to get into medical school as planned so I earned a MasterÕs from UIC. They funded me with a stipend and now I had an A- average (IÕm still mad at that one Scottish visiting professor) and this time I got into one osteopathic and two medical schools. But I also got into some excellent law schools and doctoral programs in sociology. I chose Northwestern where graduate school turned into gradual school but that wasnÕt UICs fault. The rest of my cohort at Northwestern were younger brainiacs out of elite undergrad programs like Stanford or Ivy League but UIC still prepped me well enough to earn a doctorate from Northwestern. I lived near campus (it was a dangerous and poor neighborhood at the time) in an apartment with a dog named Kamal. One of my professors became my best friend, after I earned an A we would go to Grateful Dead concerts together. I enjoyed some extra curricular activities, clubs, I was a student ambassador and got an award for that from Terry Hemmert of WXRT back when it was cool. I got arrested participating in a Divest from Apartheid protest, some of the nicest police officers ever, got donuts and coffee in jail. Years later I came back briefly for a stint as an adjunct instructor and baseball great Curtis Granderson was in the class I taught (he got a B, the only baseball player to pass the class). Chicago is a great city to live in and if you live nearby for four years and become a Cubs fan, you do get to say youÕre from Chicago, unlike those suburban posers."
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,"Hi, I did enjoy going to U of I in Chicago. At that time, it was extremely affordable and I got a top notch education, lived at home and so commuted rather than lived in a dorm. There were many programs and ways to accelerate the learning. I did not really join in as many people do when they live away from home at a college, but for me , at the time, that would have been particularly distracting. I left with no student loan debt, as I paid my way through school and had a bit of money froma grant. It is a big school so I recommend knowing yourself and if you require more one on one and student teacher ratios, or can still glean the information from large lecture halls, as was the case there for many of my classes. All in all it was very good, affordable, interesting, and had many avenues of job opportunities. I hope you enjoy college."
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,"Not at all! I went for a double B.A. there, then went on right afterwards for a double M.A. I just completed my third M. A. And back again for my fourth in urban university leadership & administration. The university is situated within the city, and the city is a classroom onto itself they can teach you just as much as the university. ItÕs affordable and I was able to earn all of these degrees paying for it out of pocket without getting myself into school loan debt. Three of my master degrees were for career purposes, so I was able to take advantage of the university proximity and affordability to move ahead in my career. The instructors, by and large, are excellent and UIC has really changed over the last 30 years and is a top research organization. The University of Illinois at Chicago has a lot to offer if you explore its resources and make the decision to take advantage. Any regrets I might have are largely personal decisions I made as a student there and not of the university itself."
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,Not at all. I got a great education. I was an art/design and then later an art education major. I had the Art Institute and a whole wonderful city full of art/museums at my doorstep. The city gave me an education about 2 times greater than the university. Universities that are situated in small towns across the USA (in my opinion) give students little more choice on free time than the local bars and drinking..
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,"No, not at all. Aside from one TA and his professor everyone was helpful and put me on a path to success. Chicago Circle Campus (as is was at that time) was in an interesting part of town. This was at a time when education was affordable and available to a low income kid like me."
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,"Not in the least. The school was still new when I started there in 1969 and some of larger buildings were not even in place as yet. One of those was the BSBÑBehavioral Sciences Building (See B&W picture, building shown at top). The school is very Architectural but was labelled as cold and weird since it is so raw with concrete. The main campus had an extensive exterior upper walkway system which added character, but I noted in 2014, the upper walkways were all gone. The rush of keeping a part time job and living at home kept me from enjoying my years there. My mother was in her last years of life and ill as well. The campus did not extend south of Taylor St although SES was finished about 1972. Now I see the school ÒOwnsÓ the Maxwell Street Police Station which was the station shown in the opening of TV series ÒHill Street Blues.Ó The staff of the school was excellent in my opinion and the whole project to construct a permanent U of I branch is one of RJ DaleyÕs great achievements I think. Now they have dorms and staff housing of which none existed in 1974. The whole area there now is gentrified(?) and this serves nearby St. Ignatius wellÑwhich then was pretty isolated by long term decline in the area. Finally, one had an unobstructed view of Sears Tower under construction from 1970Ð1974. The Sears Building opened in 1974. I almost miss my young life of those years, ahhh, maybe not."
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,"No. It was a great experience. I graduated in 1980 although I had attended another university and changed majors. Besides the obvious, getting my BSN so that I could be employed the rest of my life, the social situation in the 70s was exhilarating. Lots of my friends were red diaper babies and I spent many nights with cheap red wine and politics."
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,"never. I got an excellent education. For undergraduate I had a teacher training scholarship and ,therefore, paid only $39 a quarter. Illinois got a great 30 year teacher for their investment."
https://www.quora.com/Do-you-regret-going-to-UIC,No,Do you regret going to UIC?,"No. It was a great school and a great opportunity for me. I attended one semester at Navy Pier and then UIC opened. I met my first computer there ;-) and have been in computer science ever since. I excelled in computer science and worked at the Computer Center and helped many faculty members with programming for their research. One time I was lent out to Presbyterian St LukeÕs Hospital for a joint project with Argonne National Labs on Automatic Chromosome Analysis by Computer. The project analyzed cells and picked out damaged chromosomes. This is what amniocenteses is today.

I attended Northwestern University for Grad School and, believe me, it was not as supportive as UIC was. This was a long time ago, so, donÕt make any assumptions as to what it would be like today.

I went back to UIC as an employee and became Assistant Director of the Computer Center. My research in Computer Security led me to develop the first successful mainframe data security product, ACF2, which is still in wide use today.

UIC has been great for me."
https://www.quora.com/Which-school-should-I-join-for-an-MS-in-CS-University-of-Illinois-Chicago-or-Indiana-University-Bloomington,No,"Which school should I join for an MS in CS - University of Illinois, Chicago, or Indiana University, Bloomington?","Hello Anonymous,

You've done good research on both universities. I'll tell you everything I know about UIC, and since my knowledge about IUB is limited, I'll answer the best I can.

Coming to your queries:

> Will being in Chicago be advantageous? Does being in Chicago give you an easier job/internships opportunities - more calls? Also came to know that internship/job applications are mostly done online/career fairs, unlike India.
Answer: To some extent, being in Chicago will be advantageous. You'd get to attend job fairs that happen frequently. There's also a job fair for startups called Uncubed where you can participate. There are plenty of companies in Chicago downtown area and getting calls would be fairly easy. And yes, sadly job fairs in UIC is not all that great and everyone here apply for jobs online. People also attend Purdue or UIUC job fairs.

I felt IUB overall as a college/coursework is better; suits me, but does it lag behind because of the Bloomington - small college town location when compared to Chicago w.r.t jobs/internships. I do have a 2+ yrs work ex.
Answer: That's the trade-off you'll have to make if you select IUB. Personally, I'd say UIC course work is not very impressive compared to other colleges. DB, Data Mining and Networking have interesting assignments/projects to work on. But courses like Query Processing and Information Retrieval are very research oriented and are probably best for PhD. Your work experience will definitely come in handy while applying for internships.

> Also if I look at the USnews rankings blindly IUB (52), UIC (60).
Do these things matter - things a little here and there - considering apps for jobs/internships are done online.
I'm not looking to get into a Phd. Jobs/internships - primary concern.
Answer: Don't go by these rankings. There are many such surveys that focus on different aspects and rank universities differently. For all you know, you can end up in one of these colleges, finish your coursework, apply online and get a job at a big company like Google or Facebook. These rankings don't really matter.

> This might sound dumb - but I would get a better idea if you could give me an analogy with Indian colleges. IUB at par with IITs? UIC?
Answer: It's hard to compare these colleges to Indian colleges like IIT. I don't know much about IUB nor the current course structure in IITs. One thing about UIC is that there are no restrictions to take courses in a particular stream (like databases, networking, etc.) You have the freedom to take any course you want. In a way, it's good because you can take some random course outside of your domain because you find it interesting.
I don't know how IUB works.

If job is your priority, then Chicago would be a good place. If it's courses, then probably IUB."

2)Look at your future professors and try and find out the industry connections they have.
3)If you live in a big city in India you'll know how it is. Being in Chicago will give you lots of exposure and opportunities to meet lots of people from all over the globe and grow your network no doubt. But then it depends on you.
4)At the end of the day your skill set matters the most as each and everyone in the USA is given equal opportunity while applying for jobs. The companies will only care about the skill and your output.
PS: I cant comment on your course, but being a future graduate student in the US and also having an admit from UIC this is the best advice I have gotten up till now when it comes to choosing a college.
All the Best."

IU is a great school with a good MS program for CS though.

Make sure to consider other factors such as cost, clubs/extra curriculars, environment (Chicago vs Bloomington), and class schedules (if you work 9Ð5 M-F, IU probably wonÕt work)."

Is that actually true?","Originally Answered: I am currently admitted to UIUC (Computer Science and Mathematics, B.S.). According to usnews rankigns, CS at UIUC ranks better than at prestigious colleges like Caltech, Yale and Brown. Is that actually true?
As a Yale grad, I hate to say that it is probably actually true, UIUC ranks above several prestigious colleges. I know a great number of talented UIUC coders.

To address the heart of your question particularly at the issue of research opportunities, it depends. In the world of CS, UIUC's name carries you a long way. Outside of that world (for instance trying to be a data analyst for a hedge fund), not so much. So it really depends on how much you care about name. I think you shouldn't.

Another factor is class size. UIUC has a very large faculty and many students. The ultimate result is that they bring in lots of money and resources (and a few supercomputers). The size also reflects the fact that the department is much more organized and structured. Comparing size to the schools that you've mention, UIUC is certainly bigger. The downside is that more students means less teacher/student interaction. At the end of the day, US News is trying to determine whether or not you'll come out a good Computer Scientist and I will certainly have to say yes."
https://www.quora.com/According-to-the-U-S-News-and-World-Report-rankings-CS-at-UIUC-ranks-better-than-at-prestigious-colleges-like-Caltech-Yale-and-Brown-Is-that-actually-true,Yes,"According to the U.S. News and World Report rankings, CS at UIUC ranks better than at prestigious colleges like Caltech, Yale and Brown. Is that actually true?","Many of the answers here have a one-sided view of things and talk about one program (generally Illinois) without comparing it to others, so they don't answer the question. Here is my attempt to explain the rankings.

Average quality of UIUC CS graduates is high. They pull in good students (thanks to the ranking) and the program is tough enough to weed out the weaker students. Lecture quality is decent to good; from what I've been hearing and seeing, it's better now than when I was in undergrad.
Ivys are well regarded for their liberal arts education, but less so for technical education, as Markus Schober's answer states. The outliers being Princeton and Cornell with some of their engineering programs. ""Technical"" can even extend to fields such as accounting: check the rankings there.
Good quality, applicable research and graduate students. They keep the research money flowing in, which tends to improve rankings.
The department is large in terms of faculty and areas: you need to cover most of the major CS topics to have a high ranking. A small department will not be able to achieve as high a ranking, leading to the next item:
Maybe the most important: the number of undergraduate students going into industry and visible by the rankers is high. UIUC churns out far more CS students than the Ivys or Caltech, if I remember the numbers correctly. UC Berkeley is in a similar boat: it's no accident that it's generally at the top. When you can go to a job fair and get several qualified candidates an hour per recruiter, it holds up the school's reputation.
[Addendum]: No grade inflation at UIUC. Recently, I keep hearing from media how school or grades don't determine work ability. I'm starting to suspect that grade inflation at some schools is the reason, because I am seeing some (not strong) correlation between grades and ability for schools without grade inflation, e.g. Berkeley, Illinois, or Waterloo. So employers hire someone with a 3.5 GPA, and they get consistent quality when they hire someone else the following year with similar grades. When everyone gets a 3.5, then it's hit-or-miss, and a single bad egg can hurt a school's reputation.

I believe Caltech is a better school for some people. I believe that if you want part of your education to be the highest quality liberal arts education, you should go to an Ivy. If living in the middle of a corn field for 4-5 years will kill you, don't go to UIUC. (I spent 12 years there, and I'm very allergic to corn and soybean pollen, so I'll call you a wuss.)"
https://www.quora.com/According-to-the-U-S-News-and-World-Report-rankings-CS-at-UIUC-ranks-better-than-at-prestigious-colleges-like-Caltech-Yale-and-Brown-Is-that-actually-true,Yes,"According to the U.S. News and World Report rankings, CS at UIUC ranks better than at prestigious colleges like Caltech, Yale and Brown. Is that actually true?","Yes, the CS program at UIUC is top notch. I graduated in 2005 from the College of Engineering with a Bachelors in Computer Science. There are actually two different CS programs at UIUC. The one you are referring to is in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the other one is in the College of Engineering. You will cover many of the same course materials, but the LAS based one will have you taking more advanced math, which may or may not be what you want to do. You may prefer taking more CS courses, which I feel the CoE program gives you more flexibility in doing. (Such as Interactive Computer Graphics, Database Systems, Real-Time Systems and Embedded Systems) Take a look at the latest Fall catalog to get a sense of the courses offered -> http://courses.illinois.edu/cis/2011/fall/catalog/CS/index.html?skinId=2169.

Back to your actual question, I would say UIUC is a great place to do your undergrad as it typically costs a lot less than the other schools and you have just as many opportunities. A great example I can give you is a compiler design course I took under Vikram Adve. You may or may not have heard of him and his students, but you may very well have heard of a little thing called LLVM that is at the heart of many modern programming languages. (http://llvm.org/) I really enjoyed taking his class and I learned a lot about compilers under him. The competition is just as fierce as at the Ivy leagues and there are lots of great job opportunities and/or research opportunities available.

Take a tour of the Siebel Center and go for a visit during EOH (Engineering Open House) and get a feel for some of the work that the students do. The CS department has a lot of great SIGs that you can join outside of your normal class curriculum and I would recommend doing so. It can give you a great avenue for networking and help you meet professors that might be willing to take you on for research. As far as research and entrepreneurship buildings, there is the Beckman institute on the north end of campus and there is a relatively new research park on the south end of campus. A lot of great work being done in both of these places.

Remember you are just starting undergraduate school. You can do well at UIUC and then if you really want to go to a Caltech or Standford or Carnegie Mellon you can do that for graduate school. You won't be missing anything, plus you'll get that Big Ten school experience, which can give you valuable life experiences that are hard to put a price on.

My advice, save your money and get just as good of an education."

You mentioned computer science and mathematicsÑthat's important. If you're interested in the theoretical side of computer science (decidability, tractability, formal logic and modeling, discrete math as applied to computer science, even parts of distributed systems and learning systems), Caltech has a phenomenal program that builds off the strengths of its established and well-respected math department. Research opportunities abound.

If you're interested in software engineering, operating systems, compilers, software design, scaling infrastructure, or other real-world issues, Caltech's curriculum is weak to nonexistent. And UIUC's program, I hear, is quite good."

I really appreciated such an advanced technical education within the Liberal Arts and Sciences college. Although I was a top Math and CS student, some of my favorite classes were on random topics such as horticulture.

I attended an honors graduation ceremony where a distinguished scholar said that the very best UIUC students are equal to the best students in the world. He also said the worst UIUC students are among the worst. His point was that at UIUC, the sky is the limit. Every resource is there for you. If you work hard, you can achieve anything coming out of UIUC's Math and CS program.

The only exception I'll say is, if you're accepted into MIT or Harvard, and you can afford it, jump on it. If not, then you will never regret studying Math and CS at UIUC.

Finally, if you're a top student, look into the honors programs such as James Scholar."

The Ivy League universities reliably dominate law, the arts, business, and so forth; however, engineering is dominated by a very different set of universities (MIT, Stanford, UIUC, CMU, UT-Austin, Cornell, and so forth), and if you would like to pursue these fields, your top picks should definitely include a few of them.

The curriculum at UIUC is good, though it has a few stinkers. (Most university programs do.) In my opinion, the choices you make as a student are more important than small differences in program rankings, and there are smart, highly capable students at nearly any university. However, there is little doubt that UIUC does quite well in providing you a breadth of research opportunities and a highly marketable degree, provided you're passionate and willing to work hard."

Basically, it is one of the best programs at UIUC, which is great since you get the resources and student body of a large school combined with the curriculum of a more technical school."

Is that actually true?","I believe that it is better than Yale and Brown. I donÕt believe it is better than a Cal Tech. The fact is that engineering schools at the top state schools are better than at most private universities.

But ratings are inaccurate. They are developed to sell magazines.

Ratings are determined by graduate programs, selectivity, and faculty research. The fact is that there isnÕt a huge difference between undergraduate programs in the top 50 schools."

Is that actually true?","As far as I know, US News only ranks the graduate CS programs, not the undergrad.

The short answer is that Caltech and Yale have much smaller departments than UIUC, and well...size matters (in research rankings at least). The professors are still top-notch at Caltech and Yale though. For instance, Yale has Dan Spielman, who is one of the brightest minds in theoretical CS. Caltech's department is even smaller than Yale's, but the professors it has are also really strong in their respective areas.

If you were planning to do a PhD, you might choose Caltech, Yale or Brown over UIUC, if there was a particular professor there in your research area that you knew you wanted to work with. Since all these schools have really good quality professors, the choice boils down to what research area you want to do.

For doing less than a PhD, I would say that the larger department at UIUC gives it the advantage of possibly offering a broader curriculum, and most importantly the ability to explore almost any area of computer science in-depth. But you need to weigh that against the fact that the Ivy Leagues may give you opportunities and connections you wouldn't get from a big state school like UIUC.

Also, if your only goal is to get a BS and go work in industry, you probably only need to care about learning the fundamentals of CS (which I'm sure any of the above schools can teach you well).

If you're hoping to go beyond the standard curriculum and looking at graduate school, UIUC might be a safer bet because it will give you more options. Also, UIUC would probably be better for an MS degree, since that's more breadth focused than a PhD."

Is that actually true?","UIUC is a fabulous school for CS (I graduated 1999, BS CS/Math). If you get to know your professors (visit them in office hours, ask loads of questions) and they get to know you, there are connections to be made there to provide excellent research opportunities through both the CS department and Beckman Institute. They may also know other professors at other schools and given your interest, they might be able to connect with them and vouch for you.

The biggest thing is to get to know your profs, score high, take any extra challenges they give you and when you know the general area where you'd like to research, start asking lots of questions about who's doing what where. Ask your profs these questions.

Another opportunity is to ask your T.A.s questions about what they have liked/not liked about their research at UIUC. That can give you some clues as to who is better to work for, what is hotter, etc."

So yes, it is very good. But the guys who started Netscape left NCSA and did it on their own; I don't think there was any love lost. A big difference is that UIUC is not known for fostering student entrepreneurship, unlike Stanford, MIT, Caltech, etc. For example, I doubt UIUC has contests to give their students $100K to start a company. And I doubt you will find the PayPal or Netscape founders hanging out on campus. Go to Stanford and you might win $100K and see Sergey Brin at the gym. But perhaps things have changed since I was a post doc there 10-15 years ago."

Tell them you are from UIUC, you get a face of ""another no name school, I hope I'm not wasting time with him"".

Urbana-Champaign? Where? Yeah...

I don't have enough examples to compare as I've only came across one or two coders/architects from Ivy League schools (I'm better, of course!)."

Is that actually true?","I graduated from Yale a couple of years ago. My high school had sent a number of kids (over 20 each year) to UIUC for computer science. It had also sent a couple of kids to Yale every year (almost all of whom majored in computer science). There is no comparison. The Yale kids blew the UIUC kids out of the water in terms of their accomplishments and abilities. I'm talking top of the class, perfect GPA's, perfect or near-perfect SATs, published papers in computer science, top-level science fair awards (Intel, Siemens), and tons of cool CS projects. The students who got into and went to UIUC didn't even come close and were usually near the middle of the pack. Despite Yale's ranking in computer science, the quality of undergraduate students was superb. That's because getting into Yale is extremely difficult, and the same can be said of the other colleges listed above. I think it's a very foolish thing to pick an undergraduate college based on a departmental ranking.

Caveat: For graduate programs, UIUC probably offers far more options, since that is what departmental rankings actually measure. UIUC's department is simply bigger, so there are more opportunities to do research. That is a legitimate consideration at the GRADUATE level.

Also, don't forget that you're comparing 3 private schools with substantially more resources per undergrad to a public school that likely has huge class sizes. For undergrad, I think it's important to consider more than department ranking. If you go to a better school, you're simply going to be surrounded by better students on-the-whole. I have no doubt that the best students at UIUC are comparable to the best at Yale, Stanford, Caltech, etc. But the key difference is that the average student at a place like Yale/Stanford/Caltech will probably be a lot stronger than the average at UIUC.

I don't mean to be harsh. I just don't want high school seniors to make the misguided decision to base their college decisions on something as insignificant as one departmental ranking. After all, if you want to change majors later on, then what are you going to do?

Addendum: Just to assuage concerns: job recruitment from tech companies at all four of the schools listed (Yale, Caltech, Brown, and UIUC) is extremely good. Most students get a couple of offers from some top companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc."
